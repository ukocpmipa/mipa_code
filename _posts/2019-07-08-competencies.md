## Description

There are many different types of Microsoft Partner, from a regular Microsoft Partner Network member through to ones who've invested in advanced speclisations such as becoming an Azure Expert MSP. What helps differentiate them is the level of competency they've achieved. 

Competencies are an endorsement of a Partner's skills, experience and investment in the Microsoft ecosystem, and they bring with them benefits others do have access to. It's therefore important to invest time in attaining them as means of demonstrating to your Partner channel that you have the foundational knowledge to support them in their learning and development of new Microsoft practices.
