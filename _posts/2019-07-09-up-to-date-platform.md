## Description

An up-to-date platform is critical to providing an excellent experience for reseller partners. Whether developed in-house, or bought from a third party, it’s imperative that indirect providers use platforms which are enabled to take advantage of the developing capabilities of the CSP program. As new SKUs (such as Azure RIs) are added, resellers look immediately to use them. Opportunities can be won or lost by an indirect provider’s ability to fulfil. If the platform is out of date, an indirect provider may lose business to the competition whose platform is not.
